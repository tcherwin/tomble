## Why didn't you call this Griddle???

Frankly, I was torn.

## Source material

Five-letter words from *Gideon the Ninth* and *Harrow the Ninth*, both by the amazing Tamsyn Muir. Words from the short stories "As Yet Unsent" and "The Mysterious Study of Dr. Sex" and the novel *Nona the Ninth* are forthcoming

## Notes on valid words

Five-letter words, including proper nouns, are valid.

Words that only exist in the text as compound-adjectives are disregarded, therefore Cam's slate-brown hair sadly does not contribute to the wordlist.

"Made-up" words from the book are included - I "fealt" the books hard, so I follow their lead ;)

I am accumulating a list of manual exceptions for five letter words - for example,  "sotto" from sotto voce doesn't work on its own

Copyright, acknowledgement, and pronunciation guide is excluded from the word list.
