## Why didn't you call this Griddle???

Frankly, I was torn.

## Source material

Five-letter words from *Gideon the Ninth*, *Harrow the Ninth*, and and  *Nona the Ninth*, all by the amazing Tamsyn Muir, copyright Tamsyn Muir and published by *Tordotcom*. Words from the short stories "As Yet Unsent" and "The Mysterious Study of Dr. Sex" are forthcoming

## Notes on valid words

**Proper nouns are valid** Five-letter words, including proper nouns, are valid.

**Kiwi language, spelling, and slang terms are valid** Of course ;)

**Character slang and invented language is valid** Invented language (e.g. *necro*) and character slang (e.g. *fealt*) I "fealt" are valid words.

**Compound-adjectives are invalid** Words that only exist in the text as compound-adjectives are disregarded, therefore Cam's slate-brown hair sadly does not contribute to the wordlist.

**Uncommon sound effects are invalid** Some excluded examples include "zzzat", "ching", "ssstt"

**Artificially cut-off words are invalid** One example is "aying", which Nona overhears from a door. Presumably someone was "saying" something

**Sotto from sotto voce is invalid** I can't think of a good way to categorize this, it just didn't seem right on its own


I am accumulating a list of manual exceptions for five letter words - for example,  "sotto" from sotto voce doesn't work on its own

Copyright, acknowledgement, and pronunciation guide is excluded from the word list.
